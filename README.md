dart-tutorials
==============

A repo where I'm learning about Dart while completing some tutorials
from dartlang.org

Tutorials:

- [Create a custom element](./custom-element-dart-tutorial)
- [Use the Futures API](./futures)
- [Use Streams](./streams): Streams form a unified interface to anything that might
send out a repeating series of data
- [Sortable lists](./sortable-list): create Web Components with Polymer and Dart to create and
share libraries, components or functionalities
- [Reading files](./reading-files): use streams to read files
- [Navigating directories](./navigating-directories): a simple
app that shows how to work with files and directoreis asynchronously
- [Search the web with HttpRequest and WebSockets](./web-sockets):
app that shows how to work with Web Sockets to have a bidirectional communication
through a permanent conexion with a server
- [HTML5 persistence](https://www.dartlang.org/samples/#html5_persistence): maybe,
the most interesting tutorial is the one about
[IndexedBD](https://www.dartlang.org/docs/tutorials/indexeddb)
because the one about
[LocalStorage](https://github.com/dart-lang/dart-samples/tree/master/html5/web/localstorage/basics#localstorage-101)
seems too basic.
- *in a far future*: [Touch events](https://www.dartlang.org/samples/#touch_events)

Other tutorials that shows how to work with Dart can be found here:
