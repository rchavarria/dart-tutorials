dart-tutorials
==============

A repo where I'm learning about Dart and Polymer while completing some tutorials
from dartlang.org

Tutorials:

- [Create a custom element](./custom-element-dart-tutorial)
- [Use the Futures API](./futures)
- [Use Streams](./streams): Streams form a unified interface to anything that might
send out a repeating series of data
- [Sortable lists](./sortable-list): Create Web Components with Polymer and Dart to create and
share libraries, components or functionalities
- [Concatenating files](./concatenating-files): use streams to read files and process I/O
- *in a near future*: [Searching files for content](https://github.com/dart-lang/sample-dgrep): a simple
app that shows how to work with files and directoreis asynchronously
- *in a near future*: [Search the web with HttpRequest and WebWorker](https://github.com/dart-lang/sample-dartiverse-search):
client/server app to search on StackOverflow and Github
- *in a far future*: [HTML5 persistence](https://www.dartlang.org/samples/#html5_persistence)
- *in a far future*: [Touch events](https://www.dartlang.org/samples/#touch_events)
